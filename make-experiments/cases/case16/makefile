# Command Execution
# Each command is run in a new shell (or at least the effect is as such)

all:
	cd ..
#The cd above does not affect this line, because each command is effectively run in a new shell
	echo `pwd`

#This cd command affects the next because they are on the same line
	cd ..;echo `pwd`

#Same as above
	cd ..; \
	echo `pwd`
