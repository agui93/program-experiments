#% Wildcard

#% is really useful, but is somewhat confusing because of the variety of situations it can be used in.

#When used in "matching" mode, it matches one or more characters in a string. This match is called the stem.
#When used in "replacing" mode, it takes the stem that was matched and replaces that in a string.
#% is most often used in rule definitions and in some specific functions.

print:
	echo "about % Wildcard"
