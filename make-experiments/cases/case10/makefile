#Static Pattern Rules


#targets ...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...
#   commands

#The essence is that the given target is matched by the target-pattern (via a % wildcard). 
#Whatever was matched is called the stem. 
#The stem is then substituted into the prereq-pattern, to generate the target's prereqs.





objects = foo.o bar.o all.o
all: $(objects)

# These files compile via implicit rules
# Syntax - targets ...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...
# In the case of the first target, foo.o, the target-pattern matches foo.o and sets the "stem" to be "foo".
# It then replaces the '%' in prereq-patterns with that stem
